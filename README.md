# Tajas-Weather-Dashboard-6

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to make it easy for travelers to plan out their adventures. This project was built so that travelers will have the ability to view the weather outlook for multiple cities for days at a time. This solves the problem of not being able to plan trips according to the weather. Doing this project, I learned how to register for an API key.
